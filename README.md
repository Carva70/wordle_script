To use the Wordle script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer.

2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3.  Run the script by typing `python script.py` and pressing enter.
4.  The script will start by loading words and creating a frequency map.
5.  Next, you will be prompted to enter a 5-letter word and a string of 5 letters (g, y, or x) corresponding to the positions of the letters in the word.
6.  The script will then return a list of the top 5 words that match your input based on word frequency and the hints provided.
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6 as many times as you like to continue guessing words.
8.  To exit the script, simply close the terminal or command prompt window.

Note: The script uses a text file called "en\_words.txt" which contain all english words, if you don't have the file, you can download it from internet or you can use another file with the same format.
